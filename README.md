## Overview

Game made for [GMTK Game Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025). The theme of the jam was

**Loop**

The idea I've come up with is a 2D puzzle platformer with guns and zombies as enemies. The player is a secret agent tasked with infiltrating an abandoned hospital full of zombies in order to stop the spread of the infection. Because of the high risk of the mission, the player has access to a time loop machine. The machine will loop back to the time it was turned on once the player dies or after 2min. Once the player reaches the core of the hospital and stops the source of the infection the time loop machine will be turned off

## Core gameplay mechanics

Smooth, fast-paced player movement

Zombie enemies

Death causing time to loop back to the start

Timer that loops back to the start when it runs out

Shooting bullets that kill the enemies

Obstacles (e.g. spikes)

Rooms with enemies, parkour elements, obstacles and simple puzzles (e.g. moving blocks onto buttons to open doors)
